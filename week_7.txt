## Resolved issue with selecting multiple images
When selecting multiple images in the bokeh app, a different function is called than when a single image is selected. FIND FUNCITON NAMES
The funciton for a single image expectes images to be represented as matricies, of with 4, each column representing a colour channel in a tiff image. (R,G,B,a where a is the alpha/transparency level of the image). The function called when multiple images are selected expects the images to be represented matricies of width 3 (R,G,B) but is given matricies if width 4.
This results in the images being incorrectly interperated, and gibberish being output.
The fix came by simply calling a the appropriate function when multiple images have been selected. FIN FUNCTION NAMES
