# Week 3

This week was spent largely on the Project Specification assignment. We will aim to have a draft ready on Monday so that we can hopefully get a second one in on Wednesday. Right now we have a good understanding of the algorithms we will be "plugging" into Microscopium, but the entire process is still a big vague and seems complicated.

The specification will include:
- introduction painting a narrative to motivate the research
- aims and research questions
- methodology
- A timeline of task deadlines/expected completion dates

We are still a little unsure as to the exact methodology we will take, and what the concrete aims of the project are. Because we are used to writing standard "research reports", we are not sure how to frame the aims of microscopium, which focus more on providing a tool for data exploration and identifiying patterns in large sets of data.

Hopefully by providing a skeleton draft on Monday we can get an idea of whether or not we are on the same page as the supervisors regarding the overall aims of the project, particularly related to the 'research' aspect.
