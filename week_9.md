# Week 9 (Mid Semester Break)

This week we met with Juan and Genevieve for an afternoon of development/work. It was great being able to work with them for a few hours because any question we had, we could have imediate support. This is really handy given how many 'little things' we run into that just slow the process down when resolved via email. Having an expert nearby definitely sped the process up

## Processing Images
With Microscopium correctly installed on the remote machine, we were able to start testing the image processing capabilities of the remote machine. There were a few issues to be resolved first, but we managed to get two fixes through as pull requests that Juan accepted to the project's Github. We are now in the process of illumination correcting all of the images (55 archives!) in the BBBC021 data. Once this is done it's only tweaking a couple of things until we can finally, finally have the features extracted and the data into bokeh.

We are starting to get a little bit worried with just how long it's taking, but we're really happy with the progress we made today, so hopefully the momentum continues. The feature extraction is also going to take a fair bit of time, but once that's done, switching out the dimension reduction algorithms and assessing their performance should be fairly quick (hopefully...)

## Bash Script
Wrote a sexy little bash script for checking the archives each have an appropriate amount of images. This project is great for pushing you just a little bit outside of your comfort zone, but I've picked up so many handly skills, and been exposed to so many ways of thinking/problem solving/solution building as a result. We surprisingly found that actually, all the images decompressed correctly and there were no incomplete archives to deal with. This is great news for our overall data as the more the merrier!
