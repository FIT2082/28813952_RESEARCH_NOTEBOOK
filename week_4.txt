More work was done on the microscopium app to have the dataset working.
To do this, we will need to download the data, extract freatures, and produce a CSV that will be used to draw our results (with the bokeh app plot drawer). The CSV must contain data for each image in the data set in the following form:
index, info, neighbors, url, x, y
A portion of the BBBC021 dataset was downloaded, and had the microscopium/features.py scripts run on it, in order to...
The reason only a small portion of the available dataset was downloaded is because of the sheer size of the complete set. To give an understanding, here is an excerpt from the database: 
"There are 39,600 image files (13,200 fields of view imaged in three channels) in TIFF format. We provide the images in 55 ZIP archives, one for each microtiter plate. The archives are ~750 MB each."
And because I'm tinkering, I don't want to have to wait overnight to test my program.
