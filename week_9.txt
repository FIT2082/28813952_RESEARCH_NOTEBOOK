Week 09 (Mid Semester Break)

This week we met with Juan and Genevieve for an afternoon of development/work. It was great being able to work with them for a few hours because any question we had, we could have imediate support. This is really handy given how many 'little things' we run into that just slow the process down when resolved via email. Having an expert nearby definitely sped the process up

## Processing Images
With Microscopium correctly installed on the remote machine, we were able to start testing the image processing capabilities of the remote machine.
There were a few issues to be resolved first, but we managed to get two fixes through as pull requests that Juan accepted to the project's Github.

## quick little bash script.
wrote a sexy little for checking the archives each have an appropriate amount of images. This project is great for pushing you just a little bit outside of your comfort zone, but ive piced up so many handly skills, and been exposed to so many ways of thinking/problem solving/solution building as a result. 

## Pull Request
- alpha channels
- mean matrix

## testing
