Week 1

Assigned Research Topic:
Microscopium: clustering and interactive visualisation of high content screening images

Research Project #: 17
Research Supervisor: Juan Nunez-Iglesias
Research Team: James Ryan, Draga Doncila Pop

Microscopium Github: https://github.com/microscopium

This week saw us meet with our research supervisor, Juan Nunez-Iglesias, as well as Jenivive (who will aslo be working on the project).
The project, Microscopium, was introduced to us via a demonstration and peruseal of the jucy bits of the code.
From a broad perspective, Microscopium takes image data from a microscopic camera and runs this through an unsupervised feature extraction neural network that will, on a plot, cluster images with similar properties.
The benefit of this is that it may identifiy different, more prefered methods of cell treatment, that have similar effects to existing, less favourable treatments.

My tasks this week are largely preparitory, and include:
- Reading about tSNE, PCA an UMAT dimension reduction algorithms
- having the software running with Bokeh for python on my laptop
